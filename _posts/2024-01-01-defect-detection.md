## Overview

We introduce CUBIT-Det, a comprehensive high-resolution defect detection dataset containing over 5,500 images captured under various real-world scenarios. This dataset aims to advance automated infrastructure inspection using unmanned systems and deep learning approaches.

### Key Features
- High-resolution images captured by professional equipment
- Diverse scenarios and backgrounds
- Multiple defect categories
- Extensive benchmarking with 30+ detection methods
- Validated through real-world building inspections

## Abstract

Visual inspection of civil infrastructures has traditionally been a crucial yet labor-intensive task. In contrast, unmanned robots equipped with deep learning-based visual defect detection methods offer a more comprehensive and efficient solution compared to conventional manual inspection techniques. 

However, the full potential of deep learning in defect detection has yet to be fully realized, primarily due to the scarcity of annotated, high-quality defect datasets. In this study, we introduce CUBIT-Det, a high-resolution defect detection dataset that includes over 5500 images captured under various scenarios using professional-grade equipment. 

Distinguishing itself from existing datasets, CUBIT-Det encompasses a wide array of practical situations, backgrounds, and defect categories. We perform extensive benchmarking experiments on the dataset with nearly 30 cutting-edge real-time detection methods, and analyze both the impact of the dataset's annotation methods and zero-shot transfer ability of it. 

This effort lays a robust foundation for future advancements in defect detection solutions. Additionally, the practicality and effectiveness of CUBIT-Det are confirmed through thorough inspections of real-world buildings. Finally, we detail the features and acknowledge the limitations of our dataset, thereby highlighting significant opportunities for future research.
